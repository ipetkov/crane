# Crane

A [Nix] library for building [cargo] projects.

* **Source fetching**: automatically done using a Cargo.lock file
* **Incremental**: build your workspace dependencies just once, then quickly lint,
  build, and test changes to your project without slowing down
* **Composable**: split builds and tests into granular steps. Gate CI without
  burdening downstream consumers building from source.

## Features

* Automatic vendoring of dependencies in a way that works with Nix
  - Alternative cargo registries are supported (with a minor configuration
    change)
  - Git dependencies are automatically supported without additional
    configuration.
    - Cargo retains the flexibility to only use these dependencies when they are
      actually needed, without forcing an override for the entire workspace.
* Reusing dependency artifacts after only building them once
* [clippy] checks
* [rustfmt] checks
* [cargo-audit] for vulnerability scanning
* [cargo-nextest] a next-generation test runner
* [cargo-tarpaulin] for code coverage
* [trunk] for wasm frontend apps

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to initialize a flake from a template:

```sh
# Start with a comprehensive suite of tests
nix flake init -t github:ipetkov/crane#quick-start
```

Otherwise check out the [examples and templates] for more detailed examples. An
[API Reference] is also available.

## Compatibility Policy

Breaking changes can land on the `master` branch at any time, so it is
recommended you use a versioning strategy when consuming this library (for
example, using something like flakes or [niv]).

Tagged releases will be cut periodically and changes will be documented in the
[CHANGELOG]. Release versions will follow [Semantic Versioning].

The test suite is run against the latest stable nixpkgs release, as well as
`nixpkgs-unstable`. Any breakage on those channels is considered a bug and
should be reported as such.
