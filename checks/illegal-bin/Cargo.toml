# This cargo workspace contains a member called "examples"
# If we drop a dummy file in `src/main.rs` cargo will complain with:
#
# error: failed to load manifest for workspace member `/build/dummy-src/examples`
# Caused by:
#   failed to parse manifest at `/build/dummy-src/examples/Cargo.toml`
# Caused by:
#   the binary target name `examples` is forbidden, it conflicts with with cargo's build directory names
#
# Instead we need to drop a dummy file at `src/lib.rs`, and this is a
# regression test for that case.
