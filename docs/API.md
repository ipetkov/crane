# API Documentation

## `mkLib`

`mkLib :: pkgs -> set`

Creates a `lib` instance bound to the specified (and instantiated) `pkgs` set.
This is a convenience escape hatch in case you want to use your own custom
instantiation of nixpkgs with the overlays you may need.

```nix
mkLib (import inputs.nixpkgs { system = "armv7l-linux"; })
```

Note that if you wish to override a particular package without having to overlay
it across all of nixpkgs, consider using `overrideScope'`:

```nix
(mkLib pkgs).overrideScope' (final: prev: {
  cargo = myCustomCargoVersion;
})
```

## `lib`

### `lib.appendCrateRegistries`

`appendCrateRegistries :: [registry mapping] -> new lib`

Creates a new `lib` instance which will make additional registries available for
use when downloading crate sources. Each entry can be defined using:
* `registryFromDownloadUrl`: if you know the exact `dl` URL as defined in the
  registry's `config.json` file
* `registryFromGitIndex`: if you would like the download URL to be inferred from
  the index's source directly.

See the documentation on each function for more specifics.

```nix
newLib = lib.appendCrateRegistries [
  (lib.registryFromDownloadUrl {
    dl = "https://crates.io/api/v1/crates";
    indexUrl = "https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index";
  })

  # Or, alternatively
  (lib.registryFromGitIndex {
    url = "https://github.com/Hirevo/alexandrie-index";
    rev = "90df25daf291d402d1ded8c32c23d5e1498c6725";
  })
];
```

### `lib.buildDepsOnly`

`buildDepsOnly :: set -> drv`

Create a derivation which will only build all dependencies of a cargo workspace.

Useful for splitting up cargo projects into two derivations: one which only
builds dependencies and needs to be rebuilt when a Cargo.lock file changes, and
another which inherits the cargo artifacts from the first and (quickly) builds
just the application itself.

The exact cargo commands being run (or the arguments passed into it) can be
easily updated to suit your needs. By default all artifacts from running `cargo
{check,build,test}` will be cached.

In addition to all default and overridden values being set as documented below,
all derivation attributes are delegated to `mkCargoDerivation`, and can be used
to influence its behavior.
* `cargoArtifacts`: set to `null` since this is our entry point for generating
  cargo artifacts
* `doInstallCargoArtifacts`: set to `true`
* `pnameSuffix`: set to `"-deps"`
* `src`: set to the result of `mkDummySrc` after applying the arguments set.
  This ensures that we do not need to rebuild the cargo artifacts derivation
  whenever the application source changes.

#### Optional attributes
* `buildPhaseCargoCommand`: A command to run during the derivation's build
  phase. Pre and post build hooks will automatically be run.
  - Default value: `"${cargoCheckCommand} ${cargoExtraArgs}\n${cargoBuildCommand} ${cargoExtraArgs}"`
* `cargoBuildCommand`: A cargo (build) invocation to run during the derivation's build
  phase
  - Default value: `"cargo build --workspace --release"`
* `cargoCheckCommand`: A cargo (check) invocation to run during the derivation's build
  phase (in order to cache additional artifacts)
  - Default value: `"cargo build --workspace --release"`
* `cargoExtraArgs`: additional flags to be passed in the cargo invocation (e.g.
  enabling specific features)
* `cargoTestCommand`: A cargo invocation to run during the derivation's check
  phase
  - Default value: `"cargo test --workspace --release"`
* `cargoVendorDir`: A path (or derivation) of vendored cargo sources which can
  be consumed without network access. Directory structure should basically
  follow the output of `cargo vendor`.
  - Default value: the result of `vendorCargoDeps` after applying the arguments
    set (with the respective default values)
* `checkPhaseCargoCommand`: A command to run during the derivation's check
  phase. Pre and post check hooks will automatically be run.
  - Default value: `"${cargoTestCommand} ${cargoExtraArgs}"`
* `doCheck`: whether the derivation's check phase should be run
  - Default value: `true`
* `pname`: package name of the derivation
  - Default value: inherited from calling `crateNameFromCargoToml`
* `version`: version of the derivation
  - Default value: inherited from calling `crateNameFromCargoToml`

#### Remove attributes
The following attributes will be removed before being lowered to
`mkCargoDerivation`. If you absolutely need these attributes present as
environment variables during the build, you can bring them back via
`.overrideAttrs`.

* `cargoBuildCommand`
* `cargoCheckCommand`
* `cargoExtraArgs`
* `cargoTestCommand`

### `lib.buildPackage`

`buildPackage :: set -> drv`

A(n opinionated) version of `cargoBuild` which will install to the output any
binaries which were built by cargo in this invocation. All options understood by
`cargoBuild` apply here as well, with the only difference being some additional
book keeping necessary to log cargo's results and subsequently install from that
log.

#### Optional attributes
* `buildPhase`: the commands used by the build phase of the derivation
  - Default value: the build phase will run `preBuild` hooks, print the cargo
    version, log and evaluate `buildPhaseCargoCommand`, and run `postBuild`
    hooks
* `buildPhaseCargoCommand`: A command to run during the derivation's build
  phase. Pre and post build hooks will automatically be run.
  - Default value: `cargoBuildCommand` will be invoked along with
    `cargoExtraArgs` passed in, except cargo's build steps will also be captured
    and written to a log so that it can be used to find the build binaries.
  - Note that the default install hook assumes that the build phase will create
    a log of cargo's build results. If you wish to customize this command
    completely, make sure that cargo is run with `--message-format
    json-render-diagnostics` and the standard output captured and saved to a
    file. The `cargoBuildLog` shell variable should point to this log.
* `cargoBuildCommand`: A cargo invocation to run during the derivation's build
  phase
  - Default value: `"cargo build --workspace --release"`
* `cargoExtraArgs`: additional flags to be passed in the cargo invocation (e.g.
  enabling specific features)
  - Default value: `""`
* `doInstallCargoArtifacts`: controls whether cargo's `target` directory should
  be copied as an output
  - Default value: `false`
* `installPhase`: the commands used by the install phase of the derivation
  - Default value: the install phase will run `preInstall` hooks, look for a
    cargo build log and install all binary targets listed there, and run
    `postInstall` hooks

#### Native build dependencies and included hooks
The following hooks are automatically added as native build inputs:
* `installFromCargoBuildLogHook`

### `lib.cargoBuild`

`cargoBuild :: set -> drv`

Create a derivation which will build and test a cargo workspace.

The exact cargo command being run (or the arguments passed into it) can be
easily updated to suit your needs. If a project requires multiple cargo
invocations, they can either be run one after the other (as you'd expect in a
regular derivation), or they can be split out into separate derivations and
chained together via `cargoArtifacts` which would allow for more incremental
building and caching of the results.

Consider using `buildPackage` if all you need is to build the workspace and
install the resulting application binaries.

In addition to all default values being set as documented below, all derivation
attributes are delegated to `mkCargoDerivation`, and can be used to influence
its behavior.

#### Optional attributes
* `buildPhaseCargoCommand`: A command to run during the derivation's build
  phase. Pre and post build hooks will automatically be run.
  - Default value: `"${cargoBuildCommand} ${cargoExtraArgs}"`
* `cargoArtifacts`: A path (or derivation) which contains an existing cargo
  `target` directory, which will be reused at the start of the derivation.
  Useful for caching incremental cargo builds.
  - Default value: the result of `buildDepsOnly` after applying the arguments
    set (with the respective default values)
* `cargoBuildCommand`: A cargo invocation to run during the derivation's build
  phase
  - Default value: `"cargo build --workspace --release"`
* `cargoExtraArgs`: additional flags to be passed in the cargo invocation (e.g.
  enabling specific features)
  - Default value: `""`
* `cargoTestCommand`: A cargo invocation to run during the derivation's check
  phase
  - Default value: `"cargo test --workspace --release"`
* `cargoVendorDir`: A path (or derivation) of vendored cargo sources which can
  be consumed without network access. Directory structure should basically
  follow the output of `cargo vendor`.
  - Default value: the result of `vendorCargoDeps` after applying the arguments
    set (with the respective default values)
* `checkPhaseCargoCommand`: A command to run during the derivation's check
  phase. Pre and post check hooks will automatically be run.
  - Default value: `"${cargoTestCommand} ${cargoExtraArgs}"`
* `doCheck`: whether the derivation's check phase should be run
  - Default value: `true`
* `pname`: package name of the derivation
  - Default value: inherited from calling `crateNameFromCargoToml`
* `version`: version of the derivation
  - Default value: inherited from calling `crateNameFromCargoToml`

#### Remove attributes
The following attributes will be removed before being lowered to
`mkCargoDerivation`. If you absolutely need these attributes present as
environment variables during the build, you can bring them back via
`.overrideAttrs`.

* `cargoExtraArgs`
* `cargoTestCommand`

### `lib.cargoClippy`

`cargoClippy :: set -> drv`

  workspace.
* `cargoExtraArgs` will have `cargoClippyExtraArgs` appended to it
  - Default value: `""`
* `doCheck` is disabled
* `pnameSuffix` will be set to `"-clippy"`

#### Required attributes
* `cargoArtifacts`: A path (or derivation) which contains an existing cargo
  `target` directory, which will be reused at the start of the derivation.
  Useful for caching incremental cargo builds.
  - This can be prepared via `buildDepsOnly`
  - Alternatively, any cargo-based derivation which was built with
    `doInstallCargoArtifacts = true` will work as well

#### Optional attributes
* `cargoClippyExtraArgs`: additional flags to be passed in the clippy invocation (e.g.
  deny specific lints)
  - Default value: `""`
* `cargoExtraArgs`: additional flags to be passed in the cargo invocation (e.g.
  enabling specific features)
  - Default value: `""`
* `doInstallCargoArtifacts`: controls whether cargo's `target` directory should
  be copied as an output
  - Default value: `false`

#### Native build dependencies
The `clippy` package is automatically appended as a native build input to any
other `nativeBuildInputs` specified by the caller.

#### Remove attributes
The following attributes will be removed before being lowered to
`cargoBuild`. If you absolutely need these attributes present as
environment variables during the build, you can bring them back via
`.overrideAttrs`.

  - Default value: `""`
* `cargoExtraArgs`: additional flags to be passed in the cargo invocation
  - Default value: `""`

#### Native build dependencies
The `rustfmt` package is automatically appended as a native build input to any
other `nativeBuildInputs` specified by the caller.

#### Remove attributes
The following attributes will be removed before being lowered to
`cargoBuild`. If you absolutely need these attributes present as
environment variables during the build, you can bring them back via
`.overrideAttrs`.
* `rustFmtExtraArgs`

### `lib.cargoTarpaulin`

`cargoTarpaulin :: set -> drv`

Create a derivation which will run a `cargo tarpaulin` invocation in a cargo
workspace.

Except where noted below, all derivation attributes are delegated to

environment variables during the build, you can bring them back via
`.overrideAttrs`.
* `cargoTarpaulinExtraArgs`

### `lib.cleanCargoToml`

`cleanCargoToml :: set -> set`

Cleans all definitions from a Cargo.toml file which are irrelevant for a
minimal build of a package's dependencies. See `mkDummySrc` for more information
on how the result is applied.

In general, the following types of attributes are kept from the original input:
* basic package definitions (like name and version)
* dependency definitions
* feature definitions
* workspace definitions
* anything pertaining to project structure (like bin/lib targets, tests, etc.)

```nix
lib.cleanCargoToml { cargoToml = ./Cargo.toml; }
# { dependencies = { byteorder = "*"; }; package = { edition = "2021"; name = "simple"; version = "0.1.0"; }; }
```

#### Input attributes
* `cargoToml`: a path to a Cargo.toml file
* `cargoTomlContents`: the contents of a Cargo.toml file as a string

At least one of the above attributes must be specified, or an error will be
raised during evaluation.

### `lib.crateNameFromCargoToml`

`crateNameFromCargoToml :: set -> set`

Extract a crate's name and version from its Cargo.toml file.

```nix
lib.crateNameFromCargoToml { cargoToml = ./Cargo.toml; }
# { pname = "simple"; version = "0.1.0"; }
```

### `lib.crateRegistries`

`crateRegistries :: set`

A set of crate registries made available for use in downloading crate sources.
The keys are registry URLs as used in the Cargo.lock file (e.g.
"registry+https://...") and the values are the download URL for that registry,
including any [placeholder
values](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/registries.html#index-format)
cargo is expected to populate for downloads.

This definition can be updated via `appendCrateRegistries`.

#### Input attributes
* `src`: a directory which includes a Cargo.toml file at its root.
* `cargoToml`: a path to a Cargo.toml file
* `cargoTomlContents`: the contents of a Cargo.toml file as a string

At least one of the above attributes must be specified, or an error will be
raised during evaluation.

#### Output attributes
* `pname`: the name of the crate
  - Default value: `"cargo-package"` if the specified Cargo.toml file did not
    include a name
* `version`: the version of the crate
  - Default value: `"0.0.1"` if the specified Cargo.toml file did not
    include a version

### `lib.downloadCargoPackage`

`downloadCargoPackage :: set -> drv`

Download a packaged cargo crate (e.g. from crates.io) and prepare it for
vendoring.

#### Required input attributes
* `checksum`: the (sha256) checksum recorded in the Cargo.lock file
* `name`: the name of the crate
* `source`: the source key recorded in the Cargo.lock file
* `version`: the version of the crate

### `lib.findCargoFiles`

`findCargoFiles :: path -> set of lists`

Given a path, recursively search it for any `Cargo.toml`, `.cargo/config` or
`.cargo/config.toml` files.

```nix
lib.findCargoFiles ./src
# { cargoTomls = [ "..." ]; cargoConfigs = [ "..." ]; }
```

### `lib.fromTOML`

`fromTOML :: String -> set`

Convert a TOML string to a Nix attribute set.

```nix
lib.fromTOML (builtins.readFile ./Cargo.toml)
# { package = { edition = "2021"; name = "simple"; version = "0.1.0"; }; }
```

### `lib.mkCargoDerivation`

`mkCargoDerivation :: set -> drv`

A thin wrapper around `stdenv.mkDerivation` which includes common hooks for
building a derivation using cargo. Except where noted below, all derivation
attributes are passed straight through, so any common derivation behavior can be
used as expected.

This is a fairly low-level abstraction, so consider using `buildPackage` or
`cargoBuild` if they fit your needs.

#### Required attributes
* `buildPhaseCargoCommand`: A command (likely a cargo invocation) to run during
  the derivation's build phase. Pre and post build hooks will automatically be
  run.
* `cargoArtifacts`: A path (or derivation) which contains an existing cargo
  `target` directory, which will be reused at the start of the derivation.
  Useful for caching incremental cargo builds.
  - This can be prepared via `buildDepsOnly`
  - Alternatively, any cargo-based derivation which was built with
    `doInstallCargoArtifacts = true` will work as well
* `cargoVendorDir`: A path (or derivation) of vendored cargo sources which can
  be consumed without network access. Directory structure should basically
  follow the output of `cargo vendor`.
  - This can be prepared via `vendorCargoDeps`
* `checkPhaseCargoCommand`: A command (likely a cargo invocation) to run during
  the derivation's check phase. Pre and post check hooks will automatically be
  run.
* `pname`: the package name used for the derivation

#### Optional attributes
* `buildPhase`: the commands used by the build phase of the derivation
  - Default value: the build phase will run `preBuild` hooks, print the cargo
    version, log and evaluate `buildPhaseCargoCommand`, and run `postBuild`
    hooks
* `checkPhase`: the commands used by the check phase of the derivation
  - Default value: the check phase will run `preCheck` hooks, log and evaluate
    `checkPhaseCargoCommand`, and run `postCheck` hooks
* `doInstallCargoArtifacts`: controls whether cargo's `target` directory should
  be copied as an output
  - Default value: `true`
* `doRemapSourcePathPrefix`: Controls instructing rustc to remap the path prefix
  of any sources it captures (for example, this can include file names used in
  panic info). This is useful to omit any references to `/nix/store/...` from
  the final binary, as including them will make Nix pull in all sources when
  installing any binaries.
  - Default value: `true`
* `installPhase`: the commands used by the install phase of the derivation
  - Default value: the install phase will run `preInstall` hooks, log and evaluate
    `installPhaseCommand`, and run `postInstall` hooks
* `installPhaseCommand`: the command(s) which are expected to install the
  derivation's outputs.
  - Default value: `"mkdir -p $out"`
  - By default an output directory is created such that any other `postInstall`
    hooks can successfully run. Consider overriding this value with an
    appropriate installation commands for the package being built.
* `pnameSuffix`: a suffix appended to `pname`
  - Default value: `""`

#### Remove attributes
The following attributes will be removed before being lowered to
`stdenv.mkDerivation`. If you absolutely need these attributes present as
environment variables during the build, you can bring them back via
`.overrideAttrs`.

* `buildPhaseCargoCommand`
* `checkPhaseCargoCommand`
* `installPhaseCommand`
* `pnameSuffix`

#### Native build dependencies and included hooks
The `cargo` package is automatically appended as a native build input to any
other `nativeBuildInputs` specified by the caller, along with the following
hooks:
* `configureCargoCommonVarsHook`
* `configureCargoVendoredDepsHook`
* `inheritCargoArtifactsHook`
* `installCargoArtifactsHook`
* `remapSourcePathPrefixHook`

### `lib.mkDummySrc`

`mkDummySrc :: set -> drv`

Converts a given source directory of a cargo workspace to the smallest, most
trivial form needed to build all dependencies such that their artifacts can be
cached.

The actual source files of the project itself are ignored/replaced with
empty programs, such that changes to the source files does not invalidate any
build caches. More specifically:
* The Cargo.lock file is kept as-is
  - Any changes to it will invalidate the build cache
* Any cargo configuration files (i.e. files name `config` or `config.toml` whose
  parent directory is named `.cargo`) are kept as-is.
  - Any changes to these files will invalidate the build cache
* Any files named `Cargo.toml` are reduced via `cleanCargoToml` and the result
  is kept. Only the following changes will result in invalidating the build
  cache:
  - Any changes to listed dependencies
  - Any changes to feature definitions
  - Any changes to the workspace member metadata
  - Any changes to the `[package]` definition such as name and version
  - Any changes to the name or path of any target (such as benches, bins,
    examples, libs, or tests)

#### Required attributes
* `src`: a source directory which should be turned into a "dummy" form

#### Optional attributes
* `cargoLock`: a path to a Cargo.lock file
  - Default value: `src + /Cargo.lock`

### `lib.registryFromDownloadUrl`

`registryFromDownloadUrl :: set -> set`

Prepares a crate registry into a format that can be passed directly to
`appendCrateRegistries` using the registry's download URL.

If the registry in question has a stable download URL (which either never
changes, or it does so very infrequently), then `registryFromDownloadUrl` is a
great and lightweight choice for including the registry. To get started, look up
the
[`config.json`](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index/blob/24ecfa9c82456a79ec115736f1fcefc0be375b52/config.json#L2) at the registry's root and copy the value of the `dl` entry.

If the registry's download endpoint changes more frequently and you would like
to infer the configuration directly from a git revision, consider using
`registryFromGitIndex` as an alternative.

#### Required attributes
* `dl`: the value of the `dl` entry in the registry's `config.json` file
* `indexUrl`: an HTTP URL to the index

```nix
lib.registryFromDownloadUrl {
  dl = "https://crates.io/api/v1/crates";
  indexUrl = "https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index";
}
# { "registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index" = "https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/{crate}/{version}/download"; }
```

### `lib.registryFromGitIndex`

`registryFromGitIndex :: set -> set`

Prepares a crate registry into a format that can be passed directly to
`appendCrateRegistries` using a revision of the registry index to infer the
download URL.

Note that the specified git revision _does not need to track updates to the
index itself_ as long as the pinned revision contains the most recent version of
the `config.json` file. In other words, this commit revision only needs to be
updated if the `config.json` file changes.

Also note that this approach means that the contents of the entire index at the
specified revision will be added to the Nix store during evaluation time, and
that IFD will need to be enabled. If this is unsatisfactory, consider using
`registryFromDownloadUrl` as a simpler alternative.

#### Required attributes
* `url`: an HTTP URL to the index
* `rev`: any git revision which contains the latest `config.json` definition

```nix
lib.registryFromGitIndex {
  url = "https://github.com/Hirevo/alexandrie-index";
  rev = "90df25daf291d402d1ded8c32c23d5e1498c6725";
}
# { "registry+https://github.com/Hirevo/alexandrie-index" = "https://crates.polomack.eu/api/v1/crates/{crate}/{version}/download"; }
```

### `lib.toTOML`

`toTOML :: set -> String`

Convert an attribute set to a TOML string.

```nix
lib.toTOML { foo.bar = "baz"; }
# "[foo]\nbar = \"baz\""
```

### `lib.urlForCargoPackage`

`urlForCargoPackage :: set -> String`

Returns the URL for downloading a particular crate. For now, only crates.io is
supported.

#### Required input attributes
* `name`: the name of the crate
* `source`: the source key recorded in the Cargo.lock file
* `version`: the version of the crate

### `lib.vendorCargoDeps`

`vendorCargoDeps :: set -> drv`

Creates a derivation which will download all crates referenced by a Cargo.lock
file, and prepare a vendored directory which cargo can use for subsequent builds
without needing network access.

Each unique crate index will be vendored as its own subdirectory within the
output of the derivation. A `config.toml` file will also be placed at the root
of the output which will contain the necessary configurations to point cargo to
the vendored directories (i.e. this configuration can be appended to the
`.cargo/config.toml` definition of the project).

#### Input attributes
* `src`: a directory which includes a Cargo.lock file at its root.
* `cargoLock`: a path to a Cargo.lock file
* `cargoLockContents`: the contents of a Cargo.lock file as a string

At least one of the above attributes must be specified, or an error will be
raised during evaluation.

### `lib.writeTOML`

`writeTOML :: String -> String -> drv`

Takes a file name and an attribute set, converts the set to a TOML document and
writes it to a file with the given name.

```nix
lib.writeTOML "foo.toml" { foo.bar = "baz"; }
# «derivation /nix/store/...-foo.toml.drv»
```

## Hooks

### `configureCargoCommonVarsHook`

Defines `configureCargoCommonVars()` which will set various common cargo-related
variables, such as honoring the amount of parallelism dictated by Nix, disabling
incremental artifacts, etc. More specifically:
* `CARGO_BUILD_INCREMENTAL` is set to `false` if not already defined
* `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` is set to `$NIX_BUILD_CORES` if not already defined
* `CARGO_HOME` is set to `$PWD/.cargo-home` if not already defined.
  - The directory that `CARGO_HOME` points to will be created
* `RUST_TEST_THREADS` is set to `$NIX_BUILD_CORES` if not already defined

**Automatic behavior:** runs as a post-patch hook

### `configureCargoVendoredDepsHook`

Defines `configureCargoVendoredDeps()` which will prepare cargo to use a
directory of vendored crate sources. It takes two positional arguments:
1. a path to the vendored sources
   * If not specified, the value of `$cargoVendorDir` will be used
   * If `cargoVendorDir` is not specified, an error will be raised
1. a path to a cargo config file to modify
   * If not specified, the value of `$CARGO_HOME/config.toml` will be used
   * This cargo config file will be appended with a stanza which will instruct
     cargo to use the vendored sources (instead of downloading the sources
     directly) as follows:
       - If the vendored directory path contains a file named `config.toml`,
         then its contents will be appended to the specified cargo config path.
       - Otherwise the entire vendored directory path will be treated as if it
         only vendors the crates.io index and will be configured as such.

**Automatic behavior:** if `cargoVendorDir` is set, then
`configureCargoVendoredDeps "$cargoVendorDir" "$CARGO_HOME/config.toml"` will be
run as a pre configure hook.

### `inheritCargoArtifactsHook`

Defines `inheritCargoArtifacts()` which will pre-populate cargo's artifact
directory using a previous derivation. It takes two positional arguments:
1. a path to the previously prepared artifacts
   * If not specified, the value of `$cargoArtifacts` will be used
   * If `cargoArtifacts` is not specified, an error will be raised
   * If the specified path is a directory which contains a file called
     `target.tar.zst`, then that file will be used during unpacking
   * The previously prepared artifacts are expected to be a zstd compressed
     tarball
1. the path to cargo's artifact directory, where the previously prepared
   artifacts should be unpacked
   * If not specified, the value of `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR` will be used
   * If `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is not set, cargo's default target location  (i.e.
     `./target`) will be used.

**Automatic behavior:** if `cargoArtifacts` is set, then
`inheritCargoArtifacts "$cargoArtifacts" "$CARGO_TARGET_DIR"` will be run as a
post patch hook.

### `installCargoArtifactsHook`

Defines `prepareAndInstallCargoArtifactsDir()` which handles installing cargo's
artifact directory to the derivation's output. It takes two positional
arguments:
1. the installation directory for the output.
   * If not specified, the value of `$out` will be used
   * Cargo's artifact directory will be compressed as a reproducible tarball
     with zstd compression. It will be written to this directory and named
     `target.tar.zstd`
1. the path to cargo's artifact directory
   * If not specified, the value of `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR` will be used
   * If `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is not set, cargo's default target location  (i.e.
     `./target`) will be used.

**Automatic behavior:** if `doInstallCargoArtifacts` is set to `1`, then
`prepareAndInstallCargoArtifactsDir "$out" "$CARGO_TARGET_DIR"` will be run as a
post install hook.

### `installFromCargoBuildLogHook`

Defines `installFromCargoBuildLog()` which will use a build log produced by
cargo to find and install any binaries and libraries which have been built. It
takes two positional arguments:
1. a path to where artifacts should be installed
   * If not specified, the value of `$out` will be used
   * Binaries will be installed in a `bin` subdirectory
   * Libraries will be installed in a `lib` subdirectory
     - Note that only library targets with the `staticlib` and `cdylib`
       crate-types will be installed. Library targets with the `rlib` crate-type
       will be ignored
1. a path to a JSON formatted build log written by cargo
   * If not specified, the value of `$cargoBuildLog` will be used
   * If `cargoBuildLog` is not set, an error will be raised
   * This log can be captured, for example, via `cargo build --message-format
     json-render-diagnostics >cargo-build.json`

**Automatic behavior:** none

### `remapSourcePathPrefixHook`

Defines `remapPathPrefix()` which will instruct rustc to strip a provided source
prefix from any final binaries. This is useful for excluding any path prefixes
to the Nix store such that installing the resulting binaries does not result in
Nix also installing the crate sources as well. The function takes one positional
argument:
1. the source prefix to strip, e.g. `/nix/store/someHash-directoryName`
   * If not specified, an error will be raised

The rustc flags to perform the source remapping will be appended to _one_ of the
following environment variables:
1. `RUSTFLAGS`, if it is already present
1. `CARGO_BUILD_RUSTFLAGS` otherwise

**Note:** cargo will consume rust flags from environment variables with higher
precedence than those set via `.cargo/config.toml`, and (at the time of this
writing) it will _not merge the values_. If your project requires setting its
own rust flags, consider disabling this hook.

This hook will also define `remapPathPrefixToVendoredDir` which is a shortcut to
invoke `remapPathPrefix "$cargoVendorDir"` if `cargoVendorDir` is defined.

**Automatic behavior:** if `doRemapSourcePathPrefix` is set to `1` then
`remapPathPrefixToVendoredDir` will be run as a post configure hook.
