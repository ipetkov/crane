# Examples

This directory contains several different ways of configuring a project:

* **alt-registry**: build a cargo project which uses another crate registry
  besides crates.io
* **custom-toolchain**: build a cargo project with a custom toolchain (e.g. WASM
  builds)
* **quick-start**: build a cargo project with a comprehensive test suite
* **quick-start-simple**: build a cargo project without extra tests
