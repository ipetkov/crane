# Allow the caller to inject their own "callPackage" scope.
# This allows us to both import our packages as an overlay or flake packages,
# as well as importing them within our library scope (in a way that will also
# honor any configuration done via `lib.overrideScope').
#
# Also, worth noting that we need to pass everything through `callPackage`
# so that we can automatically get package splicing (i.e. when cross compiling
# inputs will automatically be taken from the right pkgsBuildHost, pkgsHostTarget,
# etc. scopes).
